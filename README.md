### Animal Tracking Application for Angular Code Review (_12.08.2017_)
#### By Kimberly Bordon

## Description
_This is an application that will allow zoo caretakers to track their zoo's animals. The app will allow the user to view all animals immediately, or filter the animals by their desired parameters. It will allow the caretaker to enter newly admitted animals through a form, recording a given list of details. The user can also edit an existing record._

## Specs
| Behavior | Input Example | Output Example |
|-|-|-|
| The user can view all animals currently logged upon loading the app by default. | User goes to page. | Page displays a list of all animals. |
| The user can view add a newly admitted animal. | User clicks "Add" button, and fills out a form that appears. | Page displays confirmation that animal was added, which can be exited to return to view of all animals. |
| The user can filter the animals being viewed by age, showing only young, or mature animals. | User selects "young" from drop-down menu. | Page displays list of only animals that are under 2 years old. |
| The user can edit currently existing animals by clicking "Edit" or similar edit symbol on the specific animal. | User clicks "Edit." | Edit form appears as pop-up, and user can choose to exit the window to cancel or "Save Changes." |

### Wishlist

* ~~When no animals are shown, make a message visible to user so they be informed that their filters had no matches.~~
* Better styling.
* Edit form allows all details to be edited.
* More filter options available
* Rearrange app component structure so that when either the edit form or add form appears, the change in focus is more apparent.
